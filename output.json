The institution was created by the Lagos State University Statute No. 1 of 1983. The Statute was revised in 1986 and evolved as the Lagos State Edict No. 5 of 1986. Further amendments to the Edict were made in 1990, 1992, 2004, and 2015, being the latest amendment that was assented to by the Governor on January 5, 2016. Today, the law governing the Lagos State University is cited as “LASU Law 2004 (as amended) and LASU Law 2016”."

The goals and objectives of the University were firmly stated and established by the White Paper on Tertiary Education published in July 1984 by the Military Government of Lagos State. The University was established to fulfill the following objectives: i. To form the apex of the educational system of Lagos State; ii. To provide facilities for learning; iii. To give instruction and training in such branches of knowledge as the University may desire; iv. To promote by research and other means, the advancement of knowledge and its practical application to social, cultural, economic, scientific, and technological problems; v. To encourage the advancement of learning and to provide the opportunity for acquiring higher and liberal education; vi. To act as a vehicle of national development in general and in particular to act as an instrument to effectively stimulate the development of the State through continuing education, applied research, technical assistance, direct consultation, informational services, and internship programmes; vii. To provide innovative educational programmes of high standards, regardless of the nature of the degree being pursued, as long as this has importance and relevance to State and National Development; viii. To provide ready access for citizens of the State in particular to higher education, regardless of social origin or income. ix. To meet the specific manpower needs of the State x. To serve as a creative custodian, promoter, and propagator of the State's social and cultural heritage and resources; xi. To undertake any other activity appropriate for a University of the highest standard, especially such as would enhance the greatest good of the greatest number of the people of the State. 1.2 Philosophy of the University Lagos State University was established to create opportunities for students and members of Faculty to participate in the long-established and worldwide tradition of academic excellence for the propagation of knowledge and the preservation of the University's commitment to the understanding of humanity with its concomitant concern for unraveling the natural phenomena which man seeks to domesticate."

At the beginning, the University acquired about 500 hectares of land at Ojo with a plan to have a total land area of 1,000 hectares. The University has other Campuses at Epe, and Ikeja with a vast land mass enough to accommodate more innovative projects. The Lagos State University Ojo Campus was originally conceived to be a non-residential institution. However, experience within the last two decades of its existence necessitated the review of this Philosophy. This has found a practical expression in the construction of blocks of hostels on all the Campuses, which is capable of accommodating about 8000 Students. This project is intended to improve the social conditions of our students and provide a sustainable platform for positive interactions. Nevertheless, the University will continue to assist students in procuring suitable accommodation in the neighborhood of the University."

Chapter 3 Orientation and Awareness Programme 3.1 Introduction Freshers’ Orientation Programme is the first service that the Students Affairs Division of the University provides for students. It is designed to welcome new intakes and help them make successful adjustments to the University life. The newly admitted students come from different Pre-University Institutions and they differ in many ways with respect to their academic, social, and spiritual backgrounds. Therefore, for an Institution to be able to groom this group of people with heterogeneous cultures, values, and experiences while still maintaining a reputable image for itself, the Institution must design a well-planned programme of orientation and not indoctrination."

It is therefore desirable for any University to refine and polish the mentality of its new intakes through a well-planned Orientation Programme which will make them acclimatize to the culture and standards of the University. 3.2 The Objectives of Orientation Programme The aim of the Orientation Programme is familiarization of new students with the academic, vocational, emotional, physical, spiritual, and social environments of the University."
