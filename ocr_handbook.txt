LASU STUDENTS’ HANDBOOK.

FOREWORD

I humbly welcome you to the Lagos State University,
the preferred University at the Centre of Excellence. I
congratulate you on your choice and being fortunate in
securing admission into this great citadel of learning. I
am honoured and delighted to have you here.

The primary purpose and mission of this students’
handbook is to provide students with information,
guidelines and policies that will assist in adaptation as
citizens of the Lagos State University, as well as some of the strategies for the
accomplishment of the mission.

This handbook articulates in readable form, the philosophy, objectives and
duration of programmes, admission and graduation requirements for
undergraduate students in the University, examination regulations and
guidelines, general academic regulations and ethical principles upon which
the University was founded.

It is very important for every student of the Lagos State University to
familiarize him/her self with the contents of this Handbook because ignorance
of the policies and regulations therein would not be condoned. It is also
expedient to note that, for issues not directly covered by this Handbook, the
Vice Chancellor will have responsibility regarding interpretation and
application of the Handbook.

The Lagos State University is committed to equality of educational
opportunity for all students without discriminating their race, nationality,
origin, religion, gender or special needs. The University in keeping abreast of
changing times, reserves the right to change, add or remove any part of this
publication as deemed necessary and without notice for the good of the
University and its students.

4

therefore enjoin you to consistently maintain good and quality behaviour
within and outside the University premises as a worthy ambassador of the
University.

Professor Ibiyemi Ibilola OLATUNJI-BELLO, Ph.D, mni
9th Substantive Vice Chancellor,
Lagos State University, Nigeria



LASU STUDENTS’ HANDBOOK.

MESSAGE FROM
THE DEAN OF STUDENTS

This Handbook summarises the policies and regulations of the Lagos State University
as it relates to students activities in the University. This is premised on the underlying
principle that there is a need for regulations or standards by which members of the
University Community must abide by and the mode of operations of the University
must be understandable and accessible. It is part of the overall goal of providing order
and an atmosphere supportive of learning and conducive to intellectual development.

The core objective of the Lagos State University is producing graduates that are worthy
in learning and character. The Students' Handbook contributes to providing services
which should create the platform for achieving personal career goal within the overall
context of societal well-being. Thus, the University provides a free atmosphere for
personal development while meeting the need to be responsible citizens, focusing not
only on individual productive career but also contributing to the society at large.

The Students’ Handbook is an essential companion or guide which outlines the rights
and privileges of the students and the red-lines that should not be crossed. It is a
compass which points at the next best course of action when in doubt and one of several
documents that help to foster healthy interrelationship. It embodies clear
pronouncements on freedom of association, flexibility in management and zero-
tolerance to obnoxious proclivities. The book is an essential guide for students in the
course of their curricular and extra-curricular engagements, and prospective students
could also find it as a useful source of information.

The standards set herein are binding on all registered students in the University
inclusive of students’ Organisations/Associations. Ignorance of the regulations
contained in the Book will not in any way absolve any student of the responsibility for
their actions. Students are expected to know the information contained in the
Handbook.

Once again, | admonish every student of the Lagos State University to be acquainted
with the content of this Handbook and make it as your companion. This will greatly
assist you in your quest of achieving academic excellence and having mutual beneficial
stay in the University.

LASU STUDENTS’ HANDBOOK.

| Chapter 1 4 History and Development

of the University

1.1 Introduction

Lagos State University (LASU) was established by a Bill passed by
the Lagos State House of Assembly on 22nd April, 1983 and
assented to by the first civilian Governor of Lagos State, Late
Alhaji Lateef Jakande, on 13th June, 1983. The institution was
created by the Lagos State University Statute No. 1 of 1983. The
Statute was revised in 1986 and evolved as the Lagos State Edict
No. 5 of 1986. Further amendments to the Edict were made in
1990, 1992, 2004 and 2015 being the latest amendment that was
assented to by the Governor on January 5, 2016. Today, the law
governing the Lagos State University is cited as “LASU Law 2004
(as amended) and LASU Law 2016”.

Lagos State, with its relatively well-developed industrial and
economic base, is still regarded as an educationally
disadvantaged state. It was the realization of the need to address
this disadvantage that resulted in the establishment of the Lagos
State University.

With the pioneer Vice-Chancellor, Professor Folabi Olumide
(1983-1988), Mr. S. B. Salem, the Deputy Vice-Chancellor,
(Administration) and the University Librarian, Mr. T.A.B. Seriki,
LASU took off in the 1984/85 academic session with three ‘hydra-
headed' faculties namely: Education with Professor P.A.I. Obanya
as Dean and Miss A. R. Fashola as Faculty Officer; Law and

Humanities with Professor J.A.B. Balogun as Dean and Mr. S.A.
Hundeyin as the Faculty Officer and Science with Professor F.B.A.
Giwa and Mrs. H.M. Kaka as Dean and Faculty Officer
respectively.

Many Professor have served as the Vice Chancellor of the
University. The 9th substantive Vice Chancellor, Professor
Ibiyemi Ibilola Olatunji-Bello, Ph.D., mni., a renowned Professor
of Physiology assumed office on 20th September, 2021, and has
been engaged in series of reforms of Lagos State University with
the objective of transforming it into the Best University in West
Africa with the highest and finest level of academic and research
standard.

The goals and objectives of the University were firmly stated and
established by the White Paper on Tertiary Education published
in July 1984 by the Military Government of Lagos State. The
University was established to fulfill the following objectives:

i. Toform the apex of the educational system of Lagos State;

ii. Toprovide facilities for learning;

iii. To give instruction and training in such branches of
knowledge as the University may desire;

iv. Topromote by research and other means, the advancement
of knowledge and its practical application to social,
cultural, economic, scientific and technological problems;

v. To encourage the advancement of learning and to provide
the opportunity for acquiring higher and _ liberal

Actualisation of the Objectives

For the purpose of implementing the above stated
objectives, the University consistently recruits qualified and
professional staff in the academic, administrative and
technical fields in the various segments of the University.

At the beginning, the University acquired about 500
hectares of land at Ojo witha plan to have a total land area of
1,000 hectares. The University has other Campuses at Epe,
and Ikeja with a vast land mass enough to accommodate
more innovative projects.

The Lagos State University Ojo Campus was originally
conceived to be a non-residential institution. However,
experience within the last two decades of its existence
necessitated the review of this Philosophy. This has found a
practical expression in the construction of blocks of hostel on
all the Campuses, which is capable of accommodating about
8000 Students. This project is intended to improve the social
conditions of our students and provide a sustainable
platform for positive interactions. Nevertheless, the
University will continue to assist students in procuring
suitable accommodation in the neighborhood of the
University

Furthermore, the University has developed students' village
on the parcel of land donated by the First Chancellor of the
University, the Late Justice Teslim Olawale ELIAS. The
village is situated at Mosafejo Age-Muwo about 35km from

a

the Ojo Campus of the University. The construction of the
first students’ hostel on the site was financed with the
N2million donation by the late Bashorun M.K.O. ABIOLA.

14 Campuses of the University

The University has three campuses: Ojo, Epe, and Ikeja. Ojo
Campus is the seat of administration. This campus houses the
Faculties of Arts, Education, Law, Management Sciences, Science,
Social Sciences, School of Communication, School of Transport
and Logistics, School of Library, Archival and Information
Science and Postgraduate School. Epe Campus has the Faculty of
Engineering, the Faculty of Environmental Sciences and the
School of Agriculture. Ikeja Campus is where the College of
Medicine and the University Teaching Hospital is located.

a. Ojo Campus

In June 1983, 139 hectares of land was earmarked for a campus site
by the Lagos State Government. It is located approximately 35
kilometres from Ikeja on the Lagos-Badagry Expressway. The site
has been extended to cover a total area of about 1,000 hectares for a
single University Campus.

The site has previously occupied by Government College, Ojo
and Methodist Boys High School, Lagos. The Schools had _ since
relocated to other places. The structures of these colleges were
taken over by Lagos State University, reconstructed and
extensively renovated to serve as the nucleus of the Campus.

The Ojo campus, houses the Faculties of Arts, Social Sciences,
Education, Law, Sciences, Management Sciences, School of
Transport and Logistics, School of Communication, School of
Library, Archival and Information System (LARIS), Post
Graduate School, the Centre for Environmental Science,
Education and Sustainable (CESSED), Centre for General Studies
and Centre for Planning Studies.

b. Epe Campus

Epe Campus came into existence in 1996 as a result of the untiring
efforts of the then Governor, Michael OTEDOLA who persuaded
the Military Government to release the multi-billion Naira
military barracks at Epe. The Campus is a large tract of land that
runs into thousands of acreages. Right now, a number of
buildings left by the military are being renovated to accommodate
students in the Faculties of Engineering and Environmental
Sciences as well as the School of Agriculture. The Campus can still
accommodate more academic programmes. It is a Campus
beautifully set between the coasts valley in the high cliff
landscape of Epe. Epe happens to be one of the few places with sea
cliffs in Nigeria.

c. Ikeja Campus

It is a fully residential Campus. This is located at the ever-busy
Central Business District of the State Capital. The location of the
hospital is just right as it creates easy access to those seeking
medical attention. Since the University took it over, it has
renovated a lot of buildings to make them fit its new status. The

College of Medicine as well as the Teaching Hospital inherited
both the former Ikeja General Hospital and Ayinke House, the
latter was donated by the philanthropist Mobolaji Bank-Anthony.
Ithas also taken over the Malaria Control Unit of the Hospital. The
first set of students was admitted in 1998 and that set graduated in
April 2006. In total, sixteen (16) sets of medical doctors have been
graduated to date, some of whom have obtained Master of Public
Health of LASU, Liverpool, Harvard and elsewhere and indeed
PhD of several prestigious Universities. Some others possess the
Fellowship of Postgraduate Medical Colleges and are now
Consultants and Lecturers in the College of Medicine. The Lagos
State University College of Medicine boasts of the following:

a. Central administration block with an attached auditorium

| Chapter 3 4 Orientation and Awareness

Programme

3.1 Introduction

Freshers’ Orientation Programme is the first service that the
Students Affairs Division of the University provides for
students. It is designed to welcome new intakes and help them
make successful adjustments to the University life. The newly
admitted students come from different Pre-University
Institutions and they differ in many ways with respect to their
academic, social and spiritual backgrounds. Therefore, for an
Institution to be able to groom this group of people with
heterogeneous cultures, values and experiences while still
maintaining a reputable image for itself, the Institution must
design a well-planned programme of orientation and not
indoctrination.

The image and reputation of an institution depend to a large
extent on the quality of its products (the graduates) both in
character and in learning in the Community. This quality on the
other hand, depends on the input of the students and how they
are molded or processed as they pass through the system. It is
therefore desirable for any University to refine and polish the
mentality of its new intakes through a well-planned Orientation
Programme which will make them acclimatize to the culture and
standards of the University.

c. Matriculation

All students admitted to the University for the first year of their
degree courses will be required to matriculate at a formal
ceremony (presided over by the Vice Chancellor). Matriculation
takes place after registration. Without this, no student can claim
to be a bonafide student of the University.

It must be noted that Matriculating students should sign a
Matriculation Oath Form (an undertaking to be of good
behaviour) and Matriculation Register in the faculty/school. It
must be fully endorsed by a Notary Public/Commissioner of
Oath. (Appendix 1)

d. Transition of Students

Students admitted to the College of Medicine, Faculty of
Engineering and School of Agriculture undertake their 100 level
in the Faculty of Science before transiting to their respective
campuses. Students admitted to study Medicine and Surgery
will not automatically transit to the College of Medicine.
Transition from the Faculty of Science to the College is based on
student's performance and subject to available space in the
College. Non-Transiting students are assigned to other courses
based on the choices made and subject to vacancy.

5.8 Constituents of Academic Fraud in the Lagos State

will face stiff disciplinary actions.

5.9 Personal Ethics Statement Form for Students' Assignments

submit their assignments with a personal Ethic Agreement Form.
The form has two versions: (1) for individual assignments and (2)

Itis hoped that this personal commitment will make the students
understand the value Lagos State University places on

| Chapter 7 Sq Students’ Unionism

7.1 Introduction

The Association of all registered students of the University shall
simply be known as the Students' Union. It is purely a voluntary
association and composed of the Executive, the Legislative and
the judicial arms. No arm of the Union shall refer to itself by any
other appellation other than that stated here in any form of
correspondence, public release or any other form of
communication. The adoption of any appellation may constitute
an act of misconduct for which an appropriate sanction would be
applied.

The University administration encourages the formation of an
effective, virile and responsible Students’ Union both as a means
of self-administration of students’ programmes, the regulations
of conduct and as a means of establishing effective group
communication with University Officials, so as to meet the needs
of students.

The Union is not an arm of the University Administration but it is
the creation of the University to provide leadership experiences
for students, and the opportunity for developing initiatives.

The Union has both legislative and executive powers within the
areas of its jurisdiction as may be determined by the University.
Its legislation is designed to promote the intellectual, social,
moral and physical development of every student and the
University as a whole.

The Student's Union is the link between the students' body and
the University administration. Membership of the Student's

the State Government Traffic Laws. The Union Bus(es) must not
leave the premises of the University without approval from the
Office of the Students’ Affairs.

LASU STUDENTS’ HANDBOOK.

financial or otherwise will be sanctioned according to the existing
law of the University.

d. Trading

Students are forbidden from engaging in trading activities on the
University Campus and the Students’ Union is not allowed to
admit hawkers into the Campus. Allocation of University spaces
to Vendors is strictly the prerogative of the University
Administration.

7.5 Students' Clubs and Associations

There are various recognized Students’ Organizations on
Campus. Students are therefore encouraged to join any of these,
except cult groups. Membership of recognized societies will
ensure that the students in passing through the University
benefit from all facets of the system. The activities of the
organizations help to promote social interaction among students.
Each Club has its own Constitution and must renew its approval
to operate on Campus at the beginning of each session by filling
the appraisal form, which is obtainable from the Students’ Affairs
Division. Staff Advisers to the Clubs must approve of the Club's
programme by appending their signatures before clearance is
issued to the Club by the Students’ Affairs Division.

The Staff Advisers should be involved in the election of Executive
Members of the Associations’ Clubs.

All Associations /Clubs are enjoined to kindly use the designated
Billboards for their posters and notices. Failure to use the
designated Notice Boards will lead to the affected
Clubs/ Associations redecorating the defaced walls. In certain
cases, such clubs may be proscribed or its executive members or

staff advisers sanctioned.

The list of approved Clubs and Associations are available in the
Students' Affairs Division for the attention of interested students.

7.6 Cultism/Unregistered Organisations

Membership of an Unregistered Organisation is an act of
misconduct, and belonging to a cult group in whatever form is an
act of gross misconduct for which studentship will be
withdrawn, and in certain cases, such students may also be
reported to state security services. Cultism can ultimately result
in death or permanent disability, as recent experience has shown,
so all students are advised to strongly resist any overt or covert
invitation, If you are under any form of pressure or threat, please
confide in the Students’ Affairs Division and your case shall be
discretely taken care of.

Cultism brings no benefit. The so-called benefits as claimed by
its protagonists are imaginary. So observe the following tips in
your interaction:

i. Be wary of any unsolicited help either in looking for
accommodation or registration by the co-called senior
students who may be using it to lure you to cultism.

ii/ Do not attend any exclusive party be it from male or
female student(s).

iii. Encourage your parents to accompany you to the
University.

iv. Join any clubs or associations which you are 100% sure
have been approved by the University.

v. Feel free to consult the Students’ Affairs Division and
Counselling Centre and/or your Head of Department.

7.10 Students' Excursions and Field Trips
Excursions and Field Trips are governed by the following rules
and regulations:

1.

iii.

vi.

Field Trips or excursions will be approved if considered
an essential complement to intellectual development of
students.

Field trips or excursions will be cleared with the Dean of
Faculty through the Head of Department as well as the
relevant administrative officers, after which the Dean of
Faculty will inform lecturers concerned of the absence
from classes of students involved in such trips.

Field excursions may, wherever possible, be arranged
during vacations and students should be notified before
they enter a course that such excursions during vacations
constitute a necessary part of the course.

. Field excursions normally may not occur more than once

per semester and may not exceed four class days in
duration. The idea is to reduce absence from classes to a
minimum. When two excursions per semester are
necessary, they should be staggered so as to avoid short
intervals between them. -

Organizations should submit the following to the Office of
Students’ Affairs: statement of purpose of the trip; the
benefits to be derived, survey forms; and (on return to
campus) a well written “academic report on the excursion.
Failure to submit reports on excursions will, lead to denial
of permission for any future excursions.

9.2 Use of Social Media Platforms

The global village reality is perhaps more evident today with
the availability of numerous social media platforms which
allow for ease of access and exchange of information to a far-
reaching degree. The University recognizes the limitless
opportunities that these platforms offer to students for
academic and general social interaction. Like every other social
benefit, these innovations carry with them tendencies for abuse
by their numerous users. The major concern are the tendencies
calculated to tarnish the image of fellow students, the
University or its officials and the country at large. It is for this
reason that this section is introduced to apprise students of the
limit of use of the social media while within and outside the
premises of the University. Based on this, students are implore
to use social media for academic purposes and socialization
only.

APPENDIX 2B
STUDENTS' OFFENCES AND PENALTIES
In line with the statute creating the Lagos State University, the
prescribed sanctions that students who contravene the Students'
Code of Conduct may be liable to are expulsion, rustication or
suspension.

Generally, students' Examination Misconducts are of two types:
Examination Misconduct amounting to a breach of Matriculation
Oath and Examination Misconduct amounting to Criminal
Offence. However, any conduct amounting to a criminal offence
in Nigeria will automatically qualify as a breath of students’
matriculation oath and as such liable to punishment.

For avoidance of doubt, any conduct or behaviour that is at
variance with the students’ code of conduct or in breach of the
University rules and regulations as contained in the students’
handbook, including all that are set out herein, amount to a
Breach of Matriculation Oath.
