CSC 405: SOCIAL ISSUES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (2 UNITS) - E ,"The main  aim of this course is to give students the opportunity to deve lop a software package of choice. Students are required to use the software principles learnt so far to develop at least one software package related to the industry where they are undergoing S IWES. The software should reflect the understanding of System D evelopment Life Cycle. Any programming language could be used, e.g. java, C++, etc. Students should also demonstrate ability to create and interrogate databases and their components. Each stude nt is required to submit a CD/DVD containing the source code an d the binary or compiled version of the software package at the end of SIWES to the department for assessment. The CD should also contain the documentation on how to use the software, system re quirements and installation instruction.  Record keeping is very important in business management and every company or business keeps record and accesses such records at one point or the order. A major challenge in record management is t he manual approach of record keeping which is commonly used in Nigeria. Computer Scientists attempt to solve this problem by automating record keeping using database management system concepts.  The aim of this course is to encourage each student to apply t he concepts of database management learnt in the class to the company where SIWES is undertaken. Students are required to create databases using any package of choice, e.g. MySQL, postgreSQL, M icrosoft SQL, MS -Access, Oracle, Sybase, Ingress, Informix, etc . They are also required to demonstrate ability to manipulate tables, issue queries, generate/design reports and forms, link tables, etc. Students could also demonstrate front -end programming a bility by using programming languages like PHP, VB.NET, Java, e tc in managing the database created. Each student is required to submit a CD containing the package developed at the end of SIWES to the department for assessment. The CD should also contain th e documentation on how to use the software, system requirements  and installation instruction.  The most commonly used computer applications in offices are office pac kages and this is not covered by the university curriculum, tho ugh with the understanding that students could acquire the skills during their training. Unfortunately, this never happens and many BSc. Computer Science students leave the university without a ny knowledge of office applications. The aim of this course is to expose students to office applications, e.g. MS word Excel and powerpoint. Students are required to demonstrate ability to use MS word, Excel and powerpoint or equivalent open office applica tions. MS Word: Open a new documents, format documents, change fonts size and type, insert page numbers, italicise, boldface, conversion for pdf files, equations, creation of CV, header and footnotes, mail merge, tables, tracking changes, references and bi bliography, etc. Excel: Create new spreadsheet, create records related, use formula, macros, format cells, merge cells, split cells, import text files, conversion of spreadsheet files to comma separated files, export as pdf files, etc. Powerpoint: Create s lides and presentations, use different designs, and layouts, sl ide show, slide timing tool, printing, animations,  inserting tables, figures, clip arts, slides rehearsing and recording, Document Workflow, Electronic Document Management System ,Other Office  Applications: Payroll, Pension Manager, Human Resources, Custo mer Relation Management (CRM), etc. Each student is required to submit an electronic copy in CD form of any document created using office tools listed above.  The SIWES is a work ba sed training programme for a period of six months, in the industry, under the follow up of an academic faculty member from the department of Computer Sciences, Lagos state university. SIWES gives students the opportunity to apply the knowledge acquired dur ing the BSc. Programme to the industry and also to identify problems that could be solved using computational  techniques. Students must get a formal/written approval from the head of department before proceeding on the training. Periodic reports and a fina l report must be submitted for evaluation, an oral examination is required. The first report shall be due for submission at the end of the first three weeks of SIWES. The first report which must be sent electronically to the head of department will contain  the activities of the industry, how the industry uses Computer Science / information technology, and the roles assigned to the student. The final report shall contain a summative report of the roles of the students within the industry, what was learnt, ch allenges and recommendations.
