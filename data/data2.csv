"RATIONALE AND PHILOSOPHY.The use of computers is on an historical increase in Nigeria and computers are rapidly becoming parts of our lives. This includes social networking, online shopping, teaching and research, transportation, communication, marketing, to automobiles, manufacturing, patient diagnosis; surgery; treatment and management, the list continues. Nearly all sectors, offices and businesses now use one computer application or the other.  A major challenge in Nigeria, particularly in Lagos state, is the shortage of capable computer professionals who will meet the growing needs of the nation and provide the services and expertise required. In the department of computer science, Lagos State University, we believe that it is possible to train home based computer professionals who will be capable of meeting national needs and also compare favourably with computer professionals in the international community. In view of this, the focus of our undergraduate programme is to equip our students with the right skills and knowledge relevant to the growing needs of this dynamic society.

Computer Scientists attempt to solve this problem by automating record keeping using database management system concepts. The aim of this course is to encourage each student to apply the concepts of database management learnt in the class to the company where SIWES is undertaken. Students are required to create databases using any package of choice, e.g. MySQL, postgreSQL, Microsoft SQL, MS-Access, Oracle, Sybase, Ingress, Informix, etc. They are also required to demonstrate ability to manipulate tables, issue queries, generate/design reports and forms, link tables, etc. Students could also demonstrate front-end programming ability by using programming languages like PHP, VB.NET, Java, etc in managing the database created. Each student is required to submit a CD containing the package developed at the end of SIWES to the department for assessment. The CD should also contain the documentation on how to use the software, system requirements and installation instruction.

"CSC 396: PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF DATA AND INFORMATION PRESENTATION SKILLS  (4 UNITS) - R  The most commonly used computer applications in offices are office packages and this is not covered by the university curriculum, though with the understanding that students could acquire the skills during their training. Unfortunately, this never happens and many BSc. Computer Science students leave the university without any knowledge of office applications. The aim of this course is to expose students to office applications, e.g. MS word Excel and powerpoint. Students are required to demonstrate ability to use MS word, Excel and powerpoint or equivalent open office applications. MS Word: Open a new documents, format documents, change fonts size and type, insert page numbers, italicise, boldface, conversion for pdf files, equations, creation of CV, header and footnotes, mail merge, tables, tracking changes, references and bibliography, etc. Excel: Create new spreadsheet, create records related, use formula, macros, format cells, merge cells, split cells, import text files, conversion of spreadsheet files to comma separated files, export as pdf files, etc. Powerpoint: Create slides and presentations, use different designs, and layouts, slide show, slide timing tool, printing, animations,  inserting tables, figures, clip arts, slides rehearsing and recording, Document Workflow, Electronic Document Management System ,Other Office Applications: Payroll, Pension Manager, Human Resources, Customer Relation Management (CRM), etc. Each student is required to submit an electronic copy in CD form of any document created using office tools listed above.

"CSC 398: STUDENTS’ INDUSTRIAL WORK EXPERIENCE SCHEME (SIWES) (6 UNITS) - C The SIWES is a work based training programme for a period of six months, in the industry, under the follow up of an academic faculty member from the department of Computer Sciences, Lagos state university. SIWES gives students the opportunity to apply the knowledge acquired during the BSc. Programme to the industry and also to identify problems that could be solved using computational techniques. Students must get a formal/written approval from the head of department before proceeding on the training. Periodic reports and a final report must be submitted for evaluation, an oral examination is required. The first report shall be due for submission at the end of the first three weeks of SIWES. The first report which must be sent electronically to the head of department will contain the activities of the industry, how the industry uses Computer Science / information technology, and the roles assigned to the student. The final report shall contain a summative report of the roles of the students within the industry, what was learnt, challenges and recommendations. This course cannot be taken by students not studying for the award of BSc. in Computer Sciences.
